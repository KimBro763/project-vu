Data Connection and Selections

Assumption:
There is a correlation between unemployment and its impact on mental health.

-------

Data collection and Connection:
For identifing underlying relation and mathematic proofs, we put togteher 2 main sources of data. 

1. Our data from Mental Health America's State of Mental Health in America yearly report. This is also the main sources behind our analysis and visulizations.
We pulled together YoY mental health population, population of suicide ideation by states.


2. From US Bureau of Labor to get the monthly unemployment rate by states from 2019 to 2020. 


---------

Data preparition for the machine learning model:

- All of our initial data was cleaned and stored in AWS RS service. I extracted the data live by connecting to the pgAdmin by sqlalchemy.
-We have 3 potetial tables based on the data sources. 

Given we our assumption is the relationship between unemployment data and mental health cases. We need to link this 2 seperate data sources toegtehr.
Method:
python merge.
- The tricky part is we need to use population for our analysis in order to be accurte with our stats. However, we have unrmploymrnt rate but not population.
- After the data connection, we used one of the table that contained mental health population and percentage by state to create the state population based on each year column.
Then, we merged the 2 tables of data on "year" and "state" columns.Last step was to create the "pop_unemployment" column for unemployment population based on the unemlpoyment rate
and state_population by year. 

So our master table for machine learning training and test is called new_df.
